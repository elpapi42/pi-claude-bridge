## Unreleased

## 0.1.6 — 2026-04-10

- **Fix: steer messages during tool execution now reach Claude** — when a user sends a steer while a tool is executing, pi injects it into context alongside the tool result. The bridge previously only processed tool results in this path, silently dropping the steer. Now detected and replayed as a continuation query after the current query completes.
- **Fix: "No conversation found with session ID" in dirs with dots/underscores/spaces** — bump `cc-session-io` to 0.1.2; `projectPathToHash` now matches the CLI's sanitization (`/[^a-zA-Z0-9]/g` → `-`) instead of only replacing slashes
- **Fix: steer/followUp during tool execution no longer hangs** — `extractAllToolResults` now walks past injected user messages instead of stopping at them
- **ID-based tool result matching** — tool results are matched to MCP handlers by `toolCallId` instead of FIFO position; eliminates silent wrong-result delivery if order diverges
- Add integration tests for tool execution scenarios (normal, followUp, steer, parallel+steer, abort) with auto-restart on failure
- Add `background` parameter to AskClaude — runs Claude in the background while pi continues working; result delivered as a follow-up message on completion; footer status shows progress
- Add `defaultBackground` and `defaultIsolated` config options for AskClaude
- Remove skill path aliasing (`.pi/` → `.claude/` round-trip); pass through real paths instead
- Rewrite skills block to reference MCP-bridged read tool (`mcp__custom-tools__read`)
